# GANs_digits
AI generated handwritten digits using Generative Adverserial Networks

Generator network : generates deep fake images from some random distribution
Discriminator network : discriminates between real and fake images

Upon vigorous training, the generator network successfully generates handwritten digits that even the discriminator can't identify as fake. Hence, AI generates its own handwritten digits
